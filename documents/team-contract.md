## Contract Terms

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Being responsive on Facebook and communicating with each other regularly about schedules, making changes to the project etc.

    - Respecting everyone's input and ideas in the project.

    - Distributing work evenly (going to office hours, working on milestones).


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    - Respond to messages promptly (within an hour or two).

    - Split the work evenly and make sure everyone is contributing evenly.

    - Trying to work ahead of time instead of cramming before deadlines.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - We will communicate using Facebook messenger and we will meet once a week most likely.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - Depending on who our client is, we will communicate using a mix of texting/messaging and meeting with them in person. If they are Cornell-based, we will try to set up bi-weekly meetings. If they do not live here, we will video call or conference call with them.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
    - Facilitator: in charge of organizing meetings, kind of like a project manager
    - Frontend: HTML/CSS
    - Backend: server side, PHP, database
    - Writing/Design Journey: content, keeping design process and documentation up to date
    - Client Liason: liason between team and client

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
    - Complete task by the deadline set and agreed by the team
    - Confront team members who don't meet requirements
    - We noticed that you haven't completed your task on time. Is there anything you're stuck on and need help with? If so, we can discuss as a group. Could you please complete it soon?

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
    - Majority rules
    - Have a discussion in person as a group
    - Reach out to course staff if the conflict is still not resolved

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
    - If there's a conflict, we'll re-visit

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a _fun_ clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
    - We will add to the contract if needed in the future
    - We want to have fun working on this project.

## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
