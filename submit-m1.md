## Submission

**Place an x between the [] after you have completed each step.** (example: [x])

- [x] We have checked that each resource included in our submission adheres to the course citation policy.

  Failure to adhere to the citation policy will result in a _minimum_ of a letter grade penalty for the assignment.

- [x] All of the code we am submitting is our own work.

  If you used other code as reference when writing your own code, please cite the resource via a comment.

- [x] **We have checked that our _entire_ submission has been pushed to Cornell's GitHub.**

  Failure to push to GitHub is the same as not submitting an assignment.

- [x] We am ready to have our assignment graded.
